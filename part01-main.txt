Explained to a five-year-old style [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx9YyS7-d3g)

A otherwise good starter of the actual mining process and how it is calculated is [documented here](https://www.helium.com/hnt#distribution), in short:

LongFi. Which is the combination of Heliums blockchain and the LoRaWAN frequency, is a low bandwidth and long range network that aims to get all the small things on a widespread network. LoRaWAN is better than using wi-fi as the transceiver and transmitter uses far less power. This means that Location trackers and other LoRaWAN appliances can last much longer on the same battery power. 

* Vosk gives a good introduction to Helium in this 19 May 2022 [video](https://youtu.be/17cb04Q9QdQ?t=108)
* In 2022 Helium Inc rebranded to Nova Labs - Vosk talks about it [here](https://youtu.be/17cb04Q9QdQ?t=258)

<h3 id='heading--kerlink'><a href="#heading--kerlink">Kerlink</a></h3>

This miner is manufactured by Cal-Chip and not yet available, pre-orders only.

Note that this miner requires validators to be offloaded from the miners, which is schedule to happen Q3-Q4 2021, to quote Kerlink:

> Kerlink will release miner software to run inside the gateways (full miner), but that requires the HIP25 (Validators) to be in production (to eliminate the high CPU usage on the gateways due to the Consensus Group work).
> Kerlink will eventually switch to light gateways, as any other manufacturer.

Note that eventually all miners will have their software converted to a light hotspot - per the light hotspot roadmap detailed on this page.

> Regarding the receiving sensitivity of some devices, we have been attaching great importance to it recently and have been doing related tests and experiments. Compared with other miners using SX1302 chipset, SX1308 has the following differences:
> 1. The receiving sensitivity of SX1308 is lower than that of SX1302;
> 2. In the reference design of SX1308, the FEM chip used is SE2435L, while the recommended FEM of SX1302 is SKY66420-11. The SE2435L has lower amplification gain and higher noise figure;
> 3. SX1308 will generate a lot of heat during operation, this will cause the center frequency shift.
> Combining the above reasons, the receiving sensitivity will be about ~5dB lower than other machines using the SX1302 version. Antennas and coaxial cables may affect the overall receiving sensitivity.
> Why should we choose SX1308?
> We started preparing for the Helium project in April 2021. Under the circumstances at the time, SX1308 was the least likely to be out of stock.
> solution:
> We will incorporate the temperature drift into the RSSI calculation in the V1.2.8 update;
> We are developing and testing filters and two-way signal amplifiers that can be used to correct the problem. This device can correct the inherent deficiencies of SX1308 in hardware;
> Starting from December 2021, this problem has been improved on newly produced miners;
> We are applying for a new generation of Hotspot based on the SX1302/3 baseband chipset.
> If you have any questions about such issues, please send an email to xiaohong@heltec.cn for feedback and consultation. Your data and feedback are very important to us.

Manufacturing Oversight Committee (MOC) update:

Deeper Network - Hearing Results

Yesterday, April 7, the Manufacturing Oversight Committee (MOC) held a hearing with members of the Deeper Network team and the PoC Security Working Group (POCSWG). During this hearing, the MOC heard evidence and testimony from both the POCSWG and Deeper Network. Deeper Network was given the opportunity to explain and provide evidence in defense of the finding of the POCSWG. 

Based on the evidence presented and the testimonies given during yesterday's hearing, the Manufacturing Oversight Committee (MOC) has unanimously voted that Deeper Network, whether intentionally involved or not, is in fact responsible for the gaming of Deeper Hotspots and the damage done to the Helium Network. 

Deeper Network has stated that the cheating was organized by their exclusive distributor Jhuan Information Technology Ltd. However, the MOC feels based on the testimony given by the Deeper Network team that this business relationship was a significant partnership, and whether intentionally involved or not, Deeper Network bears the responsibility and obligation to vet its distributors to ensure their integrity. 

The MOC has ruled to suspend Deeper’s Maker Key for a minimum of one year, with no further guarantee of readmission in the future. 

The hearing was recorded and can be reviewed by the community here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C7eaq1Kwd21971YAV0J4nLig0z1Zr0ks/view?usp=sharing

> As previously announced, the Manufacturing Oversight Committee (MOC) has voted to place COTX Networks under a 6 month probation for its involvement, if only negligently, with partners who constructed massive illegitimate hotspot deployments that attempted to receive Proof-of-Coverage rewards without actually providing network coverage. As part of this probation, COTX is prohibited from accepting and shipping new hotspots orders for six months, starting retroactively from September 27, 2021.
> 
> While this suspension is designed to establish a message with all manufacturers that direct involvement in "gaming" is not a tolerable nor sustainable business practice, the MOC recognizes that the Helium Network's most ardent and effective asset are hotspot hosts -- customers who have and will continue to enthusiastically purchase hotspots from approved manufacturers. As the MOC's rulings do not spread as far and wide as any manufacturer's marketing efforts, we’ve set an order fulfillment cutoff date for one week after the suspension.
> 
> This means that, with exceptions, consumer orders placed by October 4, 2021 will be allowed to be fulfilled. The full ruling is as follows:
> 
> 1. Orders must have been made on or before 1 week after the 2021-09-27 suspension. This comes to 2021-10-04.

> 2. The order quantity must be 20 units or fewer, or

COTX Suspension/Probation

The Manufacturing Oversight Committee has voted to convert COTX Network's suspension into a 6 month probation period. Under this probation COTX's ability to on-board hotspots will be restored to allow existing orders to be fulfilled subject to certain restrictions, but COTX will be prohibited from taking new orders until the probation period has ended.

We are requesting data from COTX and will describe the fulfillment process in more detail once that data arrives. We will also explain the rationale behind the suspension and probation in further announcements

> **Temporary Manufacturer Suspension: COTX**
> 
> The DeWi Manufacturing Oversight Committee (MOC) has voted to temporarily suspend COTX Networks' ability to onboard hotspots due to troubling patterns we have observed with COTX hotspots that have been deployed by their partners and employees in advance of sales to the general public at large. In the meantime, COTX will continue to provide the MOC with explanations and reports to help rectify, and hopefully, resolve the issue.
> 
> **What does the suspension do?**
> 
> While the suspension is in effect, new COTX hotspots will not be able to placed on the blockchain. Existing COTX hotspots will continue to function normally.
> 
> **Why the suspension?**
> 
> We've identified a population of COTX associated hotspots that show troubling signs of "gaming" -- attempts to earn rewards while not providing real coverage for the Helium network. While we acknowledge that any manufacturer's hotspots can be abused this way, we are compelled to take action when the hotspots are directly under the control of the manufacturer or its major partners.
> 
> **When will the suspension be lifted?**
> 
> No date has been set to re-instate COTX's onboarding ability. The suspension will only be lifted once the MOC has completed its investigation and is convinced that COTX's deployment and sales plans will benefit the network overall.

![image|485x323](upload://2t8XFo19QWqoGUHdaVtKn8wY4SL.jpeg)


There are various things to consider when positioning your miner and maximising earning potential. Considering that Helium operates on a Proof-of-Coverage algorithm, placing your miner in a location where it can communicate with other miners is the goal. The more hotspots it can communicate within a specific range, the higher probability of earning more coin over time.

Range is important. On paper (reality is [a bit more technical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9nq1h_Qes4)), it is advised to space miners 300 meters apart **from each other** (of any type). With that said, it has been reported that if line of sight is good as well, 300-350 meters can potentially be too close. If miners are too close, witnessing can become invalidated, resulting in reduced reward pay-outs.  Note that all vendor's default antennas are good for several miles of range assuming no obstructions in line of sight.

This is why you do not see mobile phone masts every block, it does not expand network coverage in a optimal way. [Do not cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8K57mbR-H8&t=207s).

To get a visual representation of how your exact location may communicate with neighboring hotspots, please check out [Hotspotty](https://hotspotty.net/). Input your address to review the sweet spot range. Your hotspot miner will be the black dot. Any additional miner that is within the red-colored heat map is considered an “invalid witness zone”. Alternatively, look at helium.vision, there is a good video demo on '[If your place is good for Helium Hotspot Mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDKNdRTxwIQ)' 

**PLEASE NOTE**: This is a over-simplified explanation, and the technical details are in [HIP17](https://voskcointalk.com/t/helium-wiki-faq/14786#heading--faq-hip17). ie. You can't have more than 1 hotspot within a res 8 hexagon (to maximise your reward scale) unless that hexagon has 2 other populated hotspots as neighbours - this of course gets complicated to explain in scale, so please see the <a href="#heading--faq-hip17">HIP17 link</a> for further detail.

On 18 May 2021, Helium announced [Disco Mode](https://blog.helium.com/uncover-your-hotspots-potential-discovery-mode-a14003ec23d) - you can use this (once you have a miner setup) to compare locations for the best rewards.

<h2 id='heading--moolah'><a href="#heading--moolah">How much will I make?</a></h2>

Please understand that the current hotspot population is growing by the day. What may be virgin territory today could be a strong hotspot region over time.

If you are curious as to if a desired location (whether it be your residence or a family friends) will be profitable, please use [Helium Explorer ](https://explorer.helium.com/). All you need to do is type in your city, and a list of active hotspots will generate.

Click on the 3 word seed phrase to open that hotspot account. From here, you’ll see a map of it’s connections, 24 hour/prior 24 hour and 30 day/prior 30 day payouts, the profit % change, along with witness and nearby hotspot information. This resource is the best tool for gauging approximate profitability in your area.

If you reviewed your territory and noticed there are no neighboring hotspots near your location, what is the next best option? Time to phone a family or friend! A plausible option is to let a fellow contact “host” your hotspot miner. That way, you are maximizing your miners profitability. 

You can also (after paying a small fee) get a rough indication of what you might earn for a particular location by using hotspotrf.com - more on them below.

This is why you don't put a high dbi in a city for example:
![image|438x500](upload://p8tQKPEWNNYCR227RdvxTAoT1g6.png)
(credit @Shwetty)
Don't be fooled by the picture of a 2dbi antenna either - the 'bubble' is huge:
![image|472x460](upload://xt62C49SbIMRoyTHBZbiZULiq6o.png)
(credit @Shwetty)


![image|675x500](upload://wpBQ2lgkNDHazWku25nker4fTB3.jpeg)
Note: 3dbi can reach out to almost 20 miles line of sight
* A good video on [how antennas work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaXm6wau-jc&t=237s)
* A good Cisco paper discussing [antenna patterns](https://www.industrialnetworking.com/pdf/Antenna-Patterns.pdf)
* Keep in mind, lower dBi antennas have more vertical range and less horizontal range. Higher ones have less vertical range and more horizontal range. Find a good balance that hits your nearby hotspots.
* Careful with 8dbi or you will overshoot hotspots that are close to you and won't witness/challenge them
* Higher gain does not mean better or stronger all it means is that it’s more directed. Think of it like a flashlight or a garden hose. The more focused the light becomes the more direct the light goes
* Antenna are environment dependent. If it’s in an urban environment a higher gain is not good you need a lower gain. If you are in open area trying reach specific point in an area than a higher gain is better
* Antenna gain is just for penetration through buildings, trees etc. Your better sticking a 3dbi high up. and a 5.8 on ground for example
![Helium-Hotspot-Antenna|690x460](upload://uoVt0v7Zzl2XbgsZxhKrb39FxNd.png) 
* Angle of elevation also matters. If you mount a long range (narrrow beam) antenna on a high elevation and all the other miners are at a lower elevation your signal will just go right over the other miners and not link up. So in the picture with the two cars a 3dbi antenna will reach the other car but the 6dbi one will not since the signal just goes right over the other car.

Handy chart from Phayu:

![Helium_Hotspots_Connector_Types_By_Makers1024_1|791x1024](upload://4IUbzl7rg2PLBVqd4l07VrEBP8N.jpeg)


This [post](https://kyk13.com/helium-hotspot-reference/) explains all that is to know about RP-SMA, N-type, as well as PoE options etc.

The short version - all miners thus far have a Reverse Polarity SMA Female connector (RP-SMA-Female) on the casing (other than the Nebra outdoor which has an N-type Female and PantherX using SMA Female)- therefore you need a RP-SMA male on the antenna cable end for most miners.
![image|690x273](upload://14jZppdPCp8Av6JgZUg817MTfcO.jpeg).

First to understand is that the 'bit in the middle' (like with other cables) does not make it male or female - it is the outer edge that does:

<h2 id='heading--app'><a href="#heading--app">Helium App Questions</a></h2>

This is a attempt at collecting and answering a number of issues/errors that occur in the Helium App

<h3 id='heading--app-registration'><a href="#heading--app-registration">Registering the miner</a></h3>

Issues with pairing or going through the registration progress (where the miner get their name)? 

Wait until the miner is 'ready' on Bobcat's this means the LED must NOT be Yellow

<h3 id='heading--app-syncing'><a href="#heading--app-syncing">Syncing to the Blockchain</a></h3>

* Initial syncing can take between 1 and 8 days - watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMXWr2LF7b8) which runs through the same points
* It takes even longer from 99.1%-99.999% than 0-98%
* If it has been "stuck" at 0 blocks or 1 blocks synced see the last bullet
* It is quite normal (as blocks are generated every ~67 seconds) for the percentage sync to drop over time as it falls behind
* If your hotspot has been at the same block for more than 24h we suggest a reboot, or trying a wired connection, otherwise - just leave it
* Some miners offer a fast-sync option, see how to access those menus [here](https://voskcointalk.com/t/helium-hnt-hotspot-mining-wiki-faq/14786#heading--faq-networkaccess-IP) a special Bobcat guide to do that is [here](https://voskcointalk.com/t/helium-hnt-hotspot-mining-wiki-faq/14786#heading--app-syncingBobcatCheck) as well
* If you do not have this option, put it in diagnostic mode and check progress that way - do not rely on Explorer/The mobile App alone

If you are feeling techie and want to pass the time whilst this is happening,
* If you have a Bobcat
  - Since 7 September 2021 the 'fast sync' method was introduced - read up on how to use it [here](https://www.bobcatminer.com/post/mind-the-gap-how-to-fix-a-huge-sync-gap)
  - You can browse to the IP address of the miner and click on the link that says "Sync Status" and see the difference between your height and the blockchain height, OR,
  - You can browse to the IP address of the miner and click on the link that says "Miner (5s, miner slow down)" - take the miner_height value and compare with the blockchain_height value
* For anything else, you can
  - Get the current blockchain height at https://api.helium.io/v1/blocks/height
  - Get your hotspot's height at: https://api.helium.io/v1/hotspots/YOUR_MINERS_ADDRESS under the 'height' field
* Or - Install this <a href="#heading--faq-apps">app</a> and go into the diagnostic screen to see what the miner 'thinks' is the current height - observe over time

<h4 id='heading--app-syncingBobcatCheck'><a href="#heading--app-syncingBobcatCheck">Bobcat Random Syncing</a></h4>

Do you feel like your Bobcat is falling in and out of the status of syncing or have you just setup your Bobcat recently and want to avoid a long initial sync delay?

NOTE: The Explorer and the App is lagged and not always up to date and cannot be relied on (Sept 2021), it might simply be saying your hotspot is 'syncing' when it is definitely not, since Bobcats allow you to check this directly with the miner we can check for it here.
 

Video guides to this process,
* Vosk runs you through fast-sync on this 29 Oct 2021 [video](https://youtu.be/9mYWcUJHUYU?t=571)
* Alternate [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPzIMeWKxtY),

Or just follow these steps,

* Browse to the IP address of your Bobcat on your local network, if you are unsure how to do that, [see this section](https://voskcointalk.com/t/helium-hnt-hotspot-mining-wiki-faq/14786#heading--faq-networkaccess-IP)
* Once successful, the page should look something like this:
![image|208x147](upload://bnchSdvMMIT1kShdnkNilyQcMpl.png)
-- If you do not see a webpage, you either have the IP address wrong or the miner's webserver is unavailable, wait 30mins and check again, if that fails, turn it off, wait a minute and turn it back on and wait 10 minutes generally resolves this
* Click on 'Sync Status', a perfectly running one will look something like this:
```
{
  "status": "synced",
  "gap": "-1",
  "miner_height": "1022841",
  "blockchain_height": "1022840",
  "epoch": "26492"
}
```
* Take a note of the 'gap' line,
-- If the value is negative it is synchronised
-- If the value is 10 or less, the status will say 'synced' and everything is OK (regardless of what Explorer says)
-- If the value is 400 or less, the miner is busy syncing and will eventually appear sync - reload this page every 10 minutes or so to check
-- If the value is above 400, follow from step 5 onwards under 'Bobcat Perpectual Sync Issue' below
* If the 'gap' over a period of several hours have narrowed to less than 100 and then suddenly jumped back up to a high value (above 400) you might have the 'Perpetual Sync Issue' please follow the steps to resolve that in the section below

<h4 id='heading--app-syncingBobcatGap'><a href="#heading--app-syncingBobcatGap">Bobcat Perpetual Sync Issue</a></h4>

This issue starting arising week-of 13 September 2021 - this may or may not help some Bobcat's perpetually syncing.

FIRST: Be 100% confident your Bobcat is perpetually syncing, this means that you have checked your Bobcat's Status screen (/status.json) and seen that the 'gap' number decreases slowly and then over time (3+ hours) reset back to a much higher again (instead of being below a gap of 10).

NOTE: The whole process takes about 6 hours

THIS METHOD IS NOT A GUARANTEED FIX. 
USERS WHO USE THIS METHOD DO SO AT THEIR OWN RISK.
PLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY (especially where it says IMPORTANT)

0. Switch to Ethernet if you can
1. Access the miner dashboard by entering the miner's IP Address into the browser. From the menu, click on Reset Miner
2. Go through the steps to get this started (type in 'I Agree', enter username: bobcat password: miner)
3. IMPORTANT, WAIT FOR THE MESSAGE BELOW TO BE DISPLAYED (might take ~20mins):
   1: your miner is going to rest
   2: housekeeper was sent home
   3: dockerd is stopped
   exit status 1
   5: detonated a bomb, old blockchain data gone
   6: detonated another bomb, miner gone
   7: the housekeeper is back, but everything is gone
   8: rebuilding everything
   9: cleaning up
   10: cleaning bomb resedue
   your miner has successfuly started, but it may take 15 minutes to load files, please be patient. you can  run the diagnoser after the light turns green
4. Go back to the miner dashboard and click on Sync Status. Do no proceed to the next step until you see your miner height above 900,000. The reason for this is because the blessed snapshot isn't confirmed as loaded until this happens. If you do this step too early, start at step
1 again.
5. Once confirmed, click on Fast sync(Alpha)
6. Again, go through the steps to get this started (type in 'I Agree', enter username: bobcat password: miner)
7. IMPORTANT WAIT FOR THE MESSAGE TO BE DISPLAYED:
   Synching your miner, please leave your power on.
8. This concludes everything you need to do to fix the perpetual gap problem

![image|225x500](upload://qYr8VSdU1PUiYNxjWlOnF25yjrL.jpeg)

Your initial assert might take a long time as your miner is probably not synced or there is a issue with the blockchain. Just be patient and have a look at the explorer under the activity tab to see if/when your assertion has gone through.

![image|230x500](upload://y0e1WjVDAdq2aSAPGvwyn9X6GdY.png)

This has been seen when updating location / antenna / height, suggestions:
* Check on the blockchain explorer if you have not already asserted (activity tab)
* As suggested - possibly try again in ~30mins

<h3 id='heading--app-transferminer'><a href="#heading--app-transferminer">How to transfer a miner</a></h3>

* Note that the hotspot being transferred should be fully synced (or within roughly 1200 blocks) to allow for a transfer
* Helium documents this well [here](https://docs.helium.com/wallets/app-wallet/transfer-hotspot/)

Leave the device for ~30 minutes, close the app, open it again and it should be showing that it is syncing.

This typically happens when the blockchain or onboarding servers (which can at times be vendor specific) has issues.

If this happens to you,

* Retrying in 15-30 minute intervals typically helps
* Keep a eye on http://status.helium.com
* If this fails for more than a day, contact the vendor

Usually means that this has already been registed, force-close and try again in 30mins, you will probably see it has registered.

![image|231x500](upload://n6bZtLZHT1EHpBllWPwJvhtBghH.jpeg)

'There was an error constructing the Add Hotspot transaction. Please try again.'

Simply force-close the app (as it likes to cache) - and try again in 30mins - this is apparently a onboarding server issue however we have seen this occur more during busy times on the Explorer website especially.

Helium has a 'tileserver' which sometimes get backed up due to the big amount of hotspots going online, over time this 'job' will re-run and add your hotspot to a tile.
